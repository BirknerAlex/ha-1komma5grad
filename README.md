# 1KOMMA5GRAD Home Assistant Integration

This is a HACS integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to integrate 1KOMMA5GRAD
into your Home Assistant instance.

This integration is not related to 1KOMMA5GRAD and not officially supported by them.

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=BirknerAlex&repository=ha-1komma5grad&category=integration)

## Limited availability

This integration is for the latest 1KOMMA5GRAD Heartbeat API.

> Warning: The new API is not available for all regions yet. The new API is required to use this integration with Home Assistant.

To check if you are using the latest generation of the Heartbeat API, check if you can log in to the
**1KOMMA5° Heartbeat** app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/1komma5-heartbeat/id6455889609),
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.onecommafive.my.production.app)).

Currently supported regions for the new API are (as of December 2025):

- Austria
- Germany
- Netherlands
- Sweden
- Switzerland

You can check this also by going to https://gaia-charge.github.io/app-not-available/ and enter `6455889609` as App ID.
This checks if the latest iOS App is available in your region, which also uses the new API.

If you are still using https://my.1komma5.io/ for login (or the old app), you are still using the old API and please use this
https://github.com/derlangemarkus/1komma5grad_ha to integrate 1KOMMA5GRAD into Home Assistant instead.

## Entities

The integration creates the following entities per system:

### Sensors

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Electricity Price | Current electricity price (incl. grid costs and VAT). Includes forecast attributes (see below). |
| Grid Feed In Power | Power currently imported from the grid (W) |
| Grid Feed Out Power | Power currently exported to the grid (W) |
| Grid Feed Power | Net grid power flow (W) |
| Consumption Power | Total household consumption (W) |
| Solar Production Power | Current solar panel output (W) |
| EV Chargers Aggregated Power | Combined power of all EV chargers (W) |
| Heat Pumps Aggregated Power | Combined power of all heat pumps (W) |
| Battery State of Charge | Battery charge level (%) |
| Battery In Power | Power flowing into the battery (W) |
| Battery Out Power | Power flowing out of the battery (W) |
| Spot Price | Current spot price (EUR/kWh, incl. VAT, without grid costs). `price_without_vat` attribute |
| Grid Costs | Current grid costs (EUR/kWh, incl. VAT). `price_without_vat` attribute |
| Grid Supply Cost Today | Cost of the energy drawn from the grid today (EUR, incl. grid costs and VAT). Other variants as attributes |
| Feed-in Earnings Today | Earnings from energy fed into the grid today (EUR) |
| Heartbeat Price | Your effective price per kWh today (EUR/kWh). `week`, `month`, `half_year` and `year` attributes |
| Comparison Price | Reference tariff your savings are compared against (EUR/kWh) |
| Heartbeat Savings 30 Days | Savings over the last 30 days (EUR) |
| Energy Trader Savings | Lifetime Energy Trader savings (EUR). `green_energy_savings` and `status` attributes |
| Energy Trader Average Monthly Savings | Average monthly Energy Trader savings (EUR) |

The last five sensors are refreshed once per hour; they stay unknown if your contract does not include the feature (e.g. Energy Trader).

Energy sensors (kWh) are also created for grid in/out, solar production, EV chargers, heat pumps, and battery in/out to enable the HA Energy Dashboard.

### Switches

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Heartbeat Automatic Mode | Toggle the Energy Management System (EMS) automatic mode on/off |

### Select

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| EV Charging Mode | Select charging mode per EV (e.g. SMART_CHARGE, SOLAR_CHARGE, QUICK_CHARGE) |

### Number

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| EV Current State of Charge | Current EV battery charge level (0-100%). Can be set manually while the EV is in SMART_CHARGE mode. |
| EV Target State of Charge | Charge level (0-100%) the EV should reach by its departure time |

### Time

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| EV Departure Time | Time by which the EV should have reached its target state of charge |

## Electricity Price Forecast

The electricity price sensor exposes future hourly prices as extra state attributes. This allows you to build automations based on upcoming prices (e.g. run appliances during the cheapest hours).

Prices for the current day are always available. Next-day prices are typically published around 14:00 CET.

### Available attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `forecast` | List of future hourly prices as `{datetime, price}` objects |
| `price_today_min` | Lowest price of the current day |
| `price_today_max` | Highest price of the current day |
| `price_today_avg` | Average price of the current day |
| `cheapest_upcoming_hour` | ISO datetime of the cheapest future hour |
| `cheapest_upcoming_price` | Price at the cheapest future hour |
| `forecast_hours_available` | Number of future hours available (indicates if next-day prices are published) |

### Template examples

You can use these in Developer Tools > Templates or in automations:

```yaml
# Current price
{{ states('sensor.electricity_price_YOUR_SYSTEM_ID') }}

# Forecast list
{{ state_attr('sensor.electricity_price_YOUR_SYSTEM_ID', 'forecast') }}

# Cheapest upcoming hour
{{ state_attr('sensor.electricity_price_YOUR_SYSTEM_ID', 'cheapest_upcoming_hour') }}

# Average price today
{{ state_attr('sensor.electricity_price_YOUR_SYSTEM_ID', 'price_today_avg') }}
```

### Automation example

Start a device when the cheapest upcoming hour begins:

```yaml
alias: "Run dishwasher at cheapest hour"
trigger:
  - platform: template
    value_template: >
      {{ now().isoformat()[:13] ==
         state_attr('sensor.electricity_price_YOUR_SYSTEM_ID', 'cheapest_upcoming_hour')[:13] }}
action:
  - service: switch.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: switch.dishwasher
```

### Sync EV SoC to EV Charger

If your EV integration exposes a battery level sensor (e.g. [Tesla](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tesla_fleet/), [Hyundai/Kia](https://github.com/Hyundai-Homeassistant/hyundai_kia_connect), [BMW](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bmw_connected_drive/), or any other), you can sync the EV's state of charge to the EV charger so it always has an accurate SoC for smart charging decisions. The example below uses Tesla, but simply replace the sensor entity with your EV's battery level sensor:

```yaml
alias: Sync EV SoC to 1KOMMA5GRAD EV Charger
description: ""
triggers:
  - entity_id: sensor.my_tesla_battery_level
    trigger: state
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: |
      {{ states('sensor.my_tesla_battery_level') | int(0) > 0 and
         states('sensor.my_tesla_battery_level') | int(0) != states('number.ev_current_state_of_charge_YOUR_SYSTEM_ID') | int(0)
      }}
actions:
  - target:
      entity_id: number.ev_current_state_of_charge_YOUR_SYSTEM_ID
    data:
      value: "{{ states('sensor.my_tesla_battery_level') | int(0) }}"
    action: number.set_value
  - delay: "00:10:00"
mode: single
```

Replace `sensor.my_tesla_battery_level` with your EV's battery level sensor entity and `number.ev_current_state_of_charge_YOUR_SYSTEM_ID` with your EV charger SoC entity.

## Diagnostics (optional)

The integration can send diagnostics to the developer so that errors and changes of the 1KOMMA5GRAD API can be found and fixed quickly. This is **disabled by default**; enable it under *Settings → Devices & services → 1KOMMA5GRAD → Configure → Send diagnostics*.

When enabled, the following is sent to a [GlitchTip](https://glitchtip.com) instance (Sentry compatible) operated by the developer:

- errors and warnings of this integration, with stack traces
- log messages of this integration
- performance traces of data refreshes and API requests (URLs without query parameters, status codes, timings)
- if the API returns an error or an unexpected response: the *structure* of the response (field names and types, never your values)
- the integration version and your Heartbeat system ID

Your credentials, name, email address and host information are never sent. The integration uses its own Sentry client, separate from Home Assistant's own Sentry integration and from other integrations.

## Warning

This integration is fully community driven and not officially supported by 1KOMMA5GRAD. Use at your own risk.
We are not responsible for any damage or issues caused by using this integration.

This integration is not affiliated with or endorsed by 1KOMMA5GRAD.

This integration is regularly tested against the following Heartbeat components:

- Chint DTSU666 (Power Meter)
- Mennekes Amtron Compact 2.0S (EV Charger)

Other components like heat pumps are not tested due to lack of hardware availability.

## API documentation

The Heartbeat API calls observed in the official app are documented as an unofficial OpenAPI spec:
**[Heartbeat API on Swagger UI](https://birkneralex.github.io/ha-1komma5grad/)** ([JSON](docs/heartbeat-openapi.json)).
It is reverse-engineered, contains no personal data and may lag behind the real API.
